Greetings! Welcome to my website. Iâ€™m a 5th year doctoral student in finance and accounting area at the [Indian Institute of Management Kashipur]( https://www.iimkashipur.ac.in), working under the guidance of [Professor Dilip Kumar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N8y4jzMAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a recipient of the **<u>Junior Research Fellowship (JRF)</u>** in Commerce, granted by the University Grants Commission (UGC) - Government of India in 2018. In my doctoral thesis, I am delving into the intricacies of corporate sustainability engagements. Recently, I had the opportunity to present one of the essays from my doctoral thesis at the online Paper Development Workshop conducted by [Birbeck Business School - University of London](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/school/business), where the paper received the **<u>Best Full Paper Award</u>**. 

I am also associated with [University of Bath School of Management](https://www.bath.ac.uk/schools/school-of-management) as a part of the **<u>GEAR Programme</u>**.

My research interests also span to:
1. Socially responsible investing
2. Accounting practices
3. Behavioural Finance
