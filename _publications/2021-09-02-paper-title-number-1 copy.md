excerpt: ''This study investigates the role of cash flow uncertainty and firm life cycle on sustainability disclosures using environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure score data. We conduct our analysis on a sample of 190 Indian firms for a period of 12â€‰years from 2010 to 2021. Drawing upon the real-option theory and organisational-inertia theory, we document a negative impact of cash flow uncertainty and firm life cycle on a firm's commitment to disclose sustainability information'.
